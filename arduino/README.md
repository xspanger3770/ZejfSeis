# Seismometer

The seimometer itself is Lehman type seismometer.

A Lehman type seismometer is a device used to detect ground motion caused by seismic activity. It uses a horizontal beam pendulum that is suspended from a stationary frame. The pendulum has a magnet attached to it and a copper coil is positioned nearby. When ground motion occurs, the magnet moves past the copper coil, inducing an electrical current which can be detected and recorded by a sensitive amplifier or data acquisition system. The Lehman seismometer is designed to be very sensitive, able to detect ground motion on the order of a few micrometers.

There are a lot of tutorials online of how you can build one. You can also check my improvised, but surprisingly well working setup:

## A few important notes

### Damping

Damping is an essential aspect of seismometer design as it reduces unwanted noise and enhances sensitivity. In my design, a plastic plate is submerged in highly viscous fluid - motor oil. This fluid provides resistance to the pendulum's motion, causing it to come to rest gradually and reducing the amplitude of its oscillations. Without this damping mechanism, the pendulum would continue to swing due to inertia, making it difficult to distinguish between seismic waves and noise. Damping ensures the pendulum settles into a stable position and detects even the smallest ground movements, improving the instrument's precision. Other damping techniques, such as magnets or electrical feedback, may also be used to enhance seismometer sensitivity.

### Frame angle

The angle of the frame relative to the vertical determines the natural period of the pendulum in a seismometer. A lower angle results in a longer period, which allows for more precise detection of long-period waves generated by major earthquakes. However, increasing the period too much can cause the pendulum to become difficult to center, leading to it getting stuck on the sides of the coil. Finding the optimal angle, therefore, requires a careful balancing of these factors. In my case, I was only able to get about 12 seconds of resonant period before the design become unstable.

### The magnets

As you can see, I used two strong neodymium magnets on both sides of the copper coil to increase induction and the instrument's overall gain. It is crucial to ensure that the magnets are correctly oriented with the same poles facing each other. This results in a highly concentrated magnetic field inside the coil while reducing the magnetic field on the outside. The high concentration of the magnetic field inside the coil results in increased sensitivity, allowing the seismometer to detect even the smallest ground movements.

While the current design of my seismometer has proven to be effective, there is still room for improvement. One area for enhancement is the use of materials, specifically the wooden beams. Wood has some degree of elasticity, which can cause the vertical beam to bend under the weight of the pendulum. To improve stability and sensitivity, better materials such as aluminum could be used instead. Additionally, the metal string that holds the pendulum may be too rigid, resulting in unwanted forces that deviate it from its central position. This can limit the maximum achievable resonance period and reduce the overall accuracy of the instrument. To overcome this issue, a more flexible string or cable could be used, allowing for smoother and more precise pendulum movements. By addressing these design considerations, the performance and accuracy of the seismometer can be further enhanced.

## ADC
In my project, an analog to digital converter (ADC) is used to achieve this conversion. The ADC device is wired up to an Arduino microcontroller, which serves as the brain of the system. The Arduino reads the digital data from the ADC and takes care of time synchronization, ensuring that the recorded data is accurately time-stamped. Once the data is prepared by the Arduino, it is sent to ZejfCSeis. This is done via a USB connection, allowing for real-time data transfer and continuous monitoring of seismic activity.

The use of modern digital technology and open-source software tools has greatly improved the accessibility and affordability of seismometers, enabling a wider range of enthusiasts like me to study earthquakes and other seismic events.

Currently, 2 highly accurate ADC's are supported: 24-bit ADS1256 and 32-bit ADS1263 and support for more can be easily added.

### ADS1256

To use the ADS1256 analog to digital converter, you will first need two Arduino libraries: [ADS1256](https://github.com/adienakhmad/ADS1256) and [libFilter](https://github.com/MartinBloedorn/libFilter). Install them as any other Arduino libraries by pasting the folders into Arduino/libraries folder on your computer. After wiring up the ADS1256, use Arduino IDE to upload sketch `ADS1256_Seismo` located in this directory.

Here is the wiring for Arduino Nano - the two wires on the right connect directly to the seimometer main coil:

I was using this ADC for about one year and it worked perfectly fine as I was able to detect many earthquakes every day from around the world. Later I switched to the more accurate ADS1263 to push the sensitivity to the limit. 

### ADS1263

Hooking up the ADS1263 is pretty simmilar to the ADS1256. The Arduino library for it can be found here: [ADS126X](https://github.com/Molorius/ADS126X) and after installing it you can upload `ADS1263_Seismo` sketch located in this directory.
